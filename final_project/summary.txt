For our project "Chillier, Not Chiller: Analyzing Twitter Data to Confirm the West-Coast-Is-More-Chill Hypothesis," we performed an empirical analysis of Twitter data in order to determine which coast (East or West) is more “chill,” according to the words used in tweets sent from those areas. We created one set of words we deemed “chill” words (e.g., “chill,” “cool,” “nice”), which tend to have mild, positive connotations, and one set of words we deemed “neurotic” words (e.g., “omg,” “ugh,” ‘hate,” “wow”), which tend to have more passionate, negative connotations. We selected four cities on the East Coast (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.) and four cities on the West Coast (Seattle, Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and San Diego) and retrieved the most recent tweets from each location by creating Twitter developer accounts (multiple accounts were necessary given data retrieval limits) and parsing Twitter data using Java code that we created. Ali created the files TweetReader.java, TweetWriter.java, Logger.java, Setup.java, which interact with the Twitter API. Next Elizabeth and Anna applied this code to our experiment and produced Main.java. The main method produces a count of each word in each of the two word sets and calculates the “chill/neurotic ratio.” This ratio is equal to the number of occurrences of “chill” words found in the past 2000 tweets sent within a 5-mile radius from a given location (specified by latitude and longitude points in TweetReader.java), divided by the number of occurrences of “neurotic” words found within those tweets. Elizabeth and Anna then executed the main method once for each location, recorded each location’s results in results.txt, and analyzed the results.
